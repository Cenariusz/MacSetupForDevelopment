## OH MY ZSH

[Starship](https://starship.rs/)
As font we will be using Hack Nerd Font in iTerm2, Sublime Text and PHPStorm.
If the theme and font changes do not apply, reload your zsh configuration (.zshrc) or close/open iTerm2.

### Oh My Zsh Plugins

* [zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions)
* [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
* [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)

### ZSH Configuration File (.zshrc):

```
# If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.
export PATH=$HOME/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

# Set Homebrew PATH
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"

# Path to your oh-my-zsh installation.
export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"

test -e "${HOME}/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh" && source "${HOME}/.iterm2_shell_integration.zsh"

# Which plugins would you like to load?
# Standard plugins can be found in $ZSH/plugins/
# Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
# Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
plugins=(
	git
)

if type brew &>/dev/null; then
	FPATH=$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh-completions:$FPATH

    autoload -Uz compinit
    compinit
fi
#You may also need to force rebuild `zcompdump`:
#rm -f ~/.zcompdump; compinit

# Additionally, if you receive "zsh compinit: insecure directories" warnings when attempting
# to load these completions, you may need to run this:
#chmod -R go-w '/opt/homebrew/share/zsh'

# activate the autosuggestions
source /opt/homebrew/share/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh

# activate the syntax highlighting
source /opt/homebrew/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
# If you receive "highlighters directory not found" error message, you may need to add the following to your .zshenv:
# export ZSH_HIGHLIGHT_HIGHLIGHTERS_DIR=/opt/homebrew/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/highlighters

source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

# use starship theme (needs to be at the end)
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

## GIT
From terminal, set global name and email:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@your-domain.com"
```

## SSH
First, create a new SSH key in the ~/.ssh folder:
```
# in case the folder is not there yet
mkdir ~/.ssh

cd ~/.ssh

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github"
# follow instructions
# use file name: github
# use passphrase and store it somewhere secure
```
Add SSH key to macOS' keychain:
```
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/github
```
Add the public key to your GitHub settings via the website or via the GitHub CLI (via brew install gh):
```
# copy public key and add it to https://github.com/
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy
```
